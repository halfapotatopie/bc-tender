Overview
========

Drizzle currently splits state concerns in two locations 1) Redux store, to
handle POJO state, and 2) the Drizzle Class instance for syncing Web3
Contract instance details.

This is necessary because web3 Contracts are
non-serializable, as the trade offs are not worth it.  See [this Redux
FAQ](https://redux.js.org/faq/organizing-state#can-i-put-functions-promises-or-other-non-serializable-items-in-my-store-state)


The problem
-----------

Web3 Contracts have a mutable sendAccount property that web3 uses to sign send
transactions. This value should reflect the current account designated by the
wallet provider and it currently is not synchronized by drizzle.

The architecture makes it difficult to sync drizzle's contract list (maintained
in the Drizzle class) with redux action originating from web3 which have no
reference to drizzle's instance.


Proposal
--------

Move maintenance of contracts into redux's middleware to facilitate this
behavior. This also consolidates all state management under the purview of
Redux.


Plan
----

[ ] Use tests to cover refactor effort. Add tests if necessary. deleteContract,
    addContract, findContractByAddress, and write test specifically for Drizzle
    class.

[ ] ./src/Drizzle.js - defines the API to add, delete, and lookup a contract by
      address.

     [ ] Drizzle::addContract - remove drizzle from action items
          [ ] preserve both `addContract` entry points, drizzle.addContract and
          drizzleStatusSaga

     [ ] Drizzle::deleteContract - remove drizzle from action item

     [ ] Drizzle::findContractByAddress - is this necessary? refactor or remove

     [ ] Drizzle::_addContract - refactor this concern which checks if the
         contract is already in our state

[ ] write a Redux middleware to handle the above API
