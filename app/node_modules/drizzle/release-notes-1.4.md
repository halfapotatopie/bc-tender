There's an old saying: March either comes in like lamb and roars out like a lion or vise-versa. Well, we can't predict the weather, but we are going out like a lion on the developer tools front! ü¶Å We've spent the last few weeks improving drizzle so your developer experience continues to be productive, efficient and fun. This release improves Redux state management, code quality and git workflow for our contributors.

*Help us help you!* ü§úü§õ It's the front-end's time to shine in the blockchain space and to that end, [we'd appreciate getting your feedback both on Drizzle itself and the general state of dapp front-end dev through this brief survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfIeWR9azcVa5SwvMetwTkRh3ioBHlgc4UOaZdrc5LIJjCdWQ/viewform).

## What's new
### Notable Improvements
 * #190 fixes the error when applying options to send or call.
 * [Updated git flow for our contributors](https://github.com/trufflesuite/drizzle/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md#forks-branches-and-pull-requests)
 * #147, #205 A better mechanism to coordinate with external services.

### Improved Redux State Creation
Drizzle is ideal for synchronizing contract state with a user interface, but as Dapps grow in complexity we foresee growing demand for coordination with off-chain services. Dapps now have the ability to more easily integrate with Drizzle's redux store for state management and event notification.

Specifically `generateStore` can be configured to mange a Dapp's reducers and sagas for better state management, and it accepts redux middleware functions to handle use cases where the Dapp needs to integrate with other services based on Drizzle events. #147 is one compelling use case for this feature.

The API is as follows:
`generateStore` create the redux store by combining drizzleOptions, application reducers and sagas.
  * param config
    - config.drizzleOptions - drizzle configuration object, required
    - config.reducers - application specific reducers, defaults to `{}`
    - config.appSagas - application sagas, defaults to `[]`
    - config.appMiddlewares - application middlewares, defaults to `[]`
    - config.disableReduxDevTools - boolean to enable/disable Redux devtools hook, defaults to `false`
  * returns a redux store
